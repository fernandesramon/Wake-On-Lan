# Wake On Lan

Wake On Lan (WOL) is a python script that wakes a Windows computer using the Wake on Lan protocol. It then connects to an SMB share on the computer and opens the folder in Finder. This program is written for a computer running MacOS.

The goal of this project was to run a network share without having to keep the computer running 24/7 for energy efficiency.

python3 wol.py
